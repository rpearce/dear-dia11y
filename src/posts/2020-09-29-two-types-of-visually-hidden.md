title: "Future-proof two types of visually hidden content"
---

Dear dia11y,

I would prefer to not hide content from anyone, but there are times when I
need to provide extra context and functionality when a design is not inclusive
enough.

The [`.visually-hidden` "clip pattern" from The A11y
Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/) is
excellent for hiding content that is intended for screen reader users, and it
can be leveraged to provide interactive elements, like `<button>`s, that reveal
themselves on focus for screen reader, keyboard, and other assistive device
users alike. Here's what that website's recommendation is:

```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

For most use cases, this is great. But my work in large codebases has shown me
that if I want this to not take up any space, I need to get bossy and guard
against future changes, as well.

```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  border: none !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  margin: 0 !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
  width: 1px !important;
}
```

While most things I do in my life aren't important to anyone but me, getting
visually hidden content right is _very_ `!important`.

With these additions we can ensure that we don't break any existing designs.

However, what if we transition from one page / view to another and need to call
`element.focus()` on a visually hidden element in order to manage focus context?
We might have something like this:

```html
<h1 class="visually-hidden" tabindex="-1">
  A necessary hidden h1 for whatever reason
</h1>
```

If we call `.focus()` on that `<h1>`, the `:not(:focus)` part of the
`.visually-hidden` definition will cause it to be _not_ hidden!

The `.visually-hidden` class is intended to be a catch-all to also account for
links and buttons, and we definitely want to leverage that, but there are times
where we _know_ we will never want it to be focused, so we can be explicit about
doing so by having an additional class, `.visually-hidden-always`, and reuse our
code via a grouped selector.

```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active),
.visually-hidden-always {
  border: none !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  margin: 0 !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
  width: 1px !important;
}
```

Something important to note is the usage of `1px`. I may be tempted to use `em`
or `rem` or `ch` or `ex` or something clever, _but I should not do this_!
Depending on the `font-size`, the browser, the monitor DPI, etc, something like
`0.1em` can end up as a half pixel and be rounded down to `0`, thus making this
inaccessible to screen readers! Use `1px`, I beg of my future self; it's okay to
use `px` for certain things.

Yours,<br />
