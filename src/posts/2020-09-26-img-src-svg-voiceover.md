title: "Image with SVG source VoiceOver bug"

Dear dia11y,

I recently documented an issue where some decorative illustration `<img />`
elements with SVG sources were, when using VoiceOver in macOS Safari, announcing
every `<g>` (group) element by narrating the word "image". Here's what the HTML
essentially was:

```html
<img
  alt=""
  class="foo"
  src="path/to/file.svg"
/>
```

The `alt=""` should have alerted the screen reader that this was a [decorative
image](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/), but no matter â€”
let's add `aria-hidden="true"` to it.

I recommended this issue and possible fix to a colleague and forgot about it.

This colleague read up on `role="presentation"` versus `aria-hidden="true"` and
whatnot and eventually discovered that neither solved the problem! What a
mystery.

This person did some digging and discovered that __image elements with SVG
sources that aren't marked as `role="img"` can have VoiceOver jump into the SVG
document and start reading things__.

The fix?

```html
<img
  alt=""
  class="foo"
  role="img"
  src="path/to/file.svg"
/>
```

That's it! HTML and a11y linters will complain about the repetitive `role`, but
we do what we have to do.

It also turned out that this was a problem with non-decorative images. Image
alternative text was being read along with the innards of SVG sources (even
`<text>` elements!).

Here are some nicely documented test cases of the issue:
